## Operation
Operations are functions that perform essential manipulations towards target
that cannot be separated to complete the life cycle of target's
reconstructibility.  Like `Construction` and `Destruction`.

## Utility
Utilities are functions that perform optional manipulations towards targets
after `Construction` and before `Destruction`, within the lifetime that is.
